TO START A REMOTE JUPYTER-LAB SESSION FOR PYDCM:

1: START JUPYTER-LAB ON THE REMOTE SERVER WITH A PORT OF YOUR CHOICE, FOR EXAMPLE:
$ jupyter lab --no-browser --port=5678
JUPYTER-LAB WILL OUTPUT A URL TO THE TERMINAL THAT YOU WILL NEED IN STEP 4

2: OPEN AN SSH TUNNEL FOR JUPYTER-LAB MAPPING THE PORT YOU CHOSE FOR JUPYTER-LAB (5678 IN
THE EXAMPLE ABOVE) AND ANOTHER PORT FOR THE WEB APP TO VISUALIZE REMOTE FILES IN YOUR
LOCAL BROWSER. THIS PORT SHOULD MATCH THE VARIABLE "WEBPORT" SET IN YOUR JUPYTER-LAB
NOTEBOOK, HERE PORT 8000
$ ssh -CNL localhost:5678:localhost:5678 -L localhost:8000:localhost:8000 user@remote-host

3: OPEN A WEB BROWSER ON YOUR LOCAL MACHINE AND PASTE IN THE URL FROM STEP 1. JUPYTER-LAB
SHOULD NOW RUN IN YOUR LOCAL WEB BROWSER

ssh -CNL localhost:8885:localhost:8885 -CNL localhost:8886:localhost:8886 -CNL localhost:8884:localhost:8884 -CNL localhost:8887:localhost:8887 -CNL localhost:8883:localhost:8883 -CNL localhost:8882:localhost:8882 -CNL localhost:8881:localhost:8881 -CNL localhost:8880:localhost:8880 -CNL localhost:8000:localhost:8000 boittier@pc-nccr-cluster.chemie.unibas.ch
